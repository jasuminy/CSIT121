  <center><p style="background-color:pink;font-size:15px;">This is a puppy that I was interesting in buying but they have alot of health problems but this was a blue merle french bulldog.</p>
    <p>I'm a big dog lover since I was a child but now since I'm older and have work, I havent had time to get another pet and last year in september, my sister had to put her dog down due to some health problems that could've been fixed but it would been very dog for the dog.
